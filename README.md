The project attempts to analyse the relationship between transfer spending and team performance among English Premier League teams from 2012 to 2023 by addressing these research questions:
1. What is the correlation between a transfer fee and winning in season 2023?

2. What is the trend of a transfer fee and winning between 2012 and 2022?
 
3. What are the differences between mean goals and assists between new and current players in season 2023?

4. How are transfer fees distributed across different positions in season 2023?
   
5. What are the differences between mean goals and assists between the highest-cost and other positions in season 2023?
   
Moreover, the insights that were found by answering those research questions:
1. There is a strong relationship between transfer spending and winning in season 2023
   
2. There is a moderate relationship between transfer spending and winning between 2012 and 2022
   
3. The current players significantly impact the club's overall performance more than the new players.
   
4. Only some clubs distribute their transfer fee across all positions, and the position that costs the clubs the most is attackers.
   
5. The highest-cost position's overall contribution to team performance significantly differs from the other positions regarding goals and assists.
   However, the contribution to team performance is the same regarding assists between the highest-cost position and midfield.

Moreover, A simple linear regression is used to predict the number of wins of the English Premier League team in the first leg of the 2024 season. This model was trained on the transfer fee and number of wins in the 2023 season, where the transfer fee is an independent variable and winning is a dependent variable. After that, the model was used to predict the number of wins in the first leg of the 2024 season using the summer transfer fee in the 2024 season as an independent variable. Figure 16 illustrates a positive correlation between the independent and dependent variables, which indicates that an increased transfer fee correlates to better performance.
 
Additionally, the source code in SQL, used to integrate and transform data, while R was used to visualise the insights for this project, can be found in the SQL and R folder.
The cleansed data used to analyse can be found in the Data folder, while the report of 2828 words can be found in the Report folder.
